# RAC-2025-Example-Prototype

This is an example Robot Prototype for RAC 2025 - CYBORC Category.
This robot is designed to achieve full marks of the challenge, using Arduino Uno as the microcontroller.


## Hardware

The chassis and other mechanical parts consists of:
- [STEM Robot Chassis Kit][chassis]
- 3D Printed Parts for Ping Pong Balls Container
  - Note: This 3D Printed part is designed with M2 Bolt and Nut Compatibility. You can simply use the [STEM Robot Chassis Kit][chassis] or any kind of chassis that compatible with M2 Bolt and Nut. We recommend using [Bambu Lab 3D Printer][bambu].

## Software

This prototype is using Maker Uno as the main controller, using Arduino Language. We will note provide the full codes for the challenge (Well if I do it's not gonna be challenge anymore isn't it ðŸ¤£?.
We do provide couple of tester code for you to get started with all the necessary elements for the robot, such as:
- Motor Driver
- Ultrasonic
- Line Following
- Servo
